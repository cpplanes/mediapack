``mediapack`` is a Python package that provides a unified interface for materials and
media definitions in the context of computational acoustics. It was designed as a support
I/O library for the research projects of the Laboratory of Acoustics of Le Mans University (LAUM UMR CNRS 6613, Le Mans Universit√©, Le Mans, France).
